## Installation

Download or clone the repository and put it into:
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Sublime Text\Packages\User`
- Mac: `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text/Packages/User`
- Linux: `~/.config/sublime-text/Packages/User`

For example, on Windows you'd have the contents of this repository in `%APPDATA%\Sublime Text\Packages\User\sublime-odin`

In Sublime Text, you can now select `View menu -> Syntax -> Odin` or use the syntax selector in the lower right corner of the Sublime window.
